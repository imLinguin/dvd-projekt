## Positional arguments:
- auth - Manage authentication
- list-games - Lists games owned by user
- install - Downloads desired selected by game slug
- wine - Allows to change compatibility layers' settings.
- launch - Play specified game

## Configuration
Script supports configuration in a text file. Which is located under `$HOME/.config/dvdProjekt/config.yaml`
When `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable is present path looks like this `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dvdProjekt/config.yaml`

You can specify config for each game differently or globally


### Priority of config:
  1. Command Line as arguments
  2. Game specific
  3. Global

### Example
```yaml
global: # global config
  gamemode: true #
  debug: true # Enables debug level of logging
  lang: 'pl' # Language that will be preffered to be downloaded for games alongside with en
  prefix: '/home/linguin/Games/dvdProjekt/prefix' # Prefix location
  wine_paths: # Additional paths where to search for wine and proton
    - /path/to/proton/directory
    - /path/to/wine/directory
    - /path/to/second/wine/directory

ghostrunner: # slug of the game
  envvars: 'PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr' # Enviroment variables to be passed when launching the game
  prefix: '/home/linguin/Games/dvdProjekt/ghost_runner_prefix' # Prefix for that game only
```

By default dvdprojekt searches for proton and wine in these directories:
- `$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/`,
- `$HOME/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/`,
- `$HOME/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/`
